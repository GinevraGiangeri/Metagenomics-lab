# **STRIM STRatification In Metagenomics**

## **Description**
the STRIM code is useful to calculate, starting from a dataset, the abundancies of the KEGG pathways and it allows to define the stratification of the taxonomies for every different function. In other words, the stratification of the taxonomy means that the code enables the user to determine at which taxonomic level a specific KEGG function is found.
